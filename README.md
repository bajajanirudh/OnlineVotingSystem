# OnlineVotingSystem
It is a desktop application made with socket programming in Python. It uses flask, synchronous multithreading, blockchain methods.

## Motivation
Illiteracy is not the only reason for low percentage voting in India. None of us wants to wake up early in the morning to stand in long queues in the sun to cast a vote. So we are developing a Online Voting System which will enable people to cast their vote while sitting in the home.

## Objectives
1. To increase the voting percentage.
2. Remove human fallibility from the tabulation process of Election.

## How to install and run
### Requirements
1. VS Code (or any other alternative)
2. Django

Once you have both the requirements fulfilled, then open the command prompt, and run **python homePage.py**, then the desktop application will open.
